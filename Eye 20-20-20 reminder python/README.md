These BAT files make it easy to run or control the reminder without typing Python commands:

| File name | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **start_eye_break_reminder.bat** | Starts the reminder in **normal mode** (with sound). Use this if you want the 20-minute reminder with chimes. |
| **start_eye_break_reminder_quiet.bat** | Starts the reminder in **quiet mode** (no sounds). Useful if you‚Äôre in a meeting or don‚Äôt want audio alerts. |

> üí° You can place a shortcut to `start_eye_break_reminder.bat` or `start_eye_break_reminder_quiet.bat` in your Windows **Startup** folder to have it run automatically when you log in.

## üì• Installation

1. **Download** or copy these files into a folder of your choice:

   * `eye_break_popup.pyw` (the main script)
   * `start_eye_break_reminder.bat` (normal mode)
   * `start_eye_break_reminder_quiet.bat` (quiet mode ‚Äî no sound)
   * `stop_eye_break_reminder.bat` (to stop the reminder loop)

2. **(Optional)** Create a shortcut to `start_eye_break_reminder.bat` in your Windows Startup folder:

   * Press `Win + R`
   * Type:

     ```
     shell:startup
     ```
   * Press Enter.
   * Place the shortcut there ‚Äî the reminder will start automatically when you log in.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

* **Normal mode:** double-click `start_eye_break_reminder.bat`
* **Quiet mode:** double-click `start_eye_break_reminder_quiet.bat`
* **Stop the reminder:** double-click `stop_eye_break_reminder.bat` or press **Stop (Exit)** on any popup.

---

## üîß Controls

Inside the popup:

* **Snooze** ‚Äî delays the reminder by a few minutes.
* **Skip** ‚Äî closes the popup until the next scheduled reminder.
* **Stop (Exit)** ‚Äî ends the reminder loop completely.

Outside the popup:

* Create a file called `STOP_20BREAK.flag` in the script folder to stop the reminder.
* Create a file called `QUIET_20BREAK.flag` in the script folder to mute sounds (remove it to unmute).

---

## üìö How It Works

* Runs a timer in the background.

* Every `INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default: 20) it:

  1. Detects your active monitor.
  2. Shows a centered, always-on-top popup.
  3. Plays a gentle chime (unless in quiet mode).
  4. Counts down `BREAK_SECONDS` (default: 20 seconds).
  5. Plays an ending chime (unless in quiet mode).

* If your PC is **locked**, the timer pauses and restarts when you unlock.

---

## üõ† Changing Settings

To adjust:

* **Interval between reminders**
* **Break duration**
* **Snooze time**
* **Popup size**

Open `eye_break_popup.pyw` in any text editor (Notepad works) and look for:

```python
INTERVAL_MINUTES = 20
BREAK_SECONDS    = 20
SNOOZE_MINUTES   = 5
WINDOW_SIZE      = (560, 300)
```

Change the numbers, save, and restart the script.

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**Python not found:**

* Make sure Python is installed and added to PATH.
* Try replacing `py -3w` in the `.bat` file with the full path to your `pythonw.exe`
  (e.g., `C:\Users\YourName\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\pythonw.exe`).

**Popup doesn‚Äôt appear after locking/unlocking:**

* Make sure you didn‚Äôt stop the reminder loop.
* Check if `STOP_20BREAK.flag` exists ‚Äî delete it if you want to resume.

**Sounds don‚Äôt play:**

* Ensure you‚Äôre not in quiet mode (`QUIET_20BREAK.flag` missing).
* Check if your speakers are on.
